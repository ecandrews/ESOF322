1.) External .jar dependencies:
* groovy-all-2.4.6.jar
* hamcrest-core-1.3.jar
* junit-4.12.jar

2.) We wrote this program using the IntelliJ IDEA IDE, so we did not run the program from the command line, nor did we have any run configurations.

3.) 
	Our version of the project is very strong in terms of the GUI and user interaction. Our GUI is very clean looking, and JavaFX allows us to easily add different images to the framework of the GUI, which means it was very simple to add a new theme to the game without needing to change any of the overall structure of the gameplay itself. The downside to this is that by using JavaFX, it was difficult to keep the visuals structurally separate from the code itself.
	For our project, we successfully used two different design patterns that were covered in class. We used the Abstract Factory design pattern to allow the user to choose between two different versions of the game to play, and we used the Model View Controller design pattern to keep our code structured and organized. Using these design patterns makes our code easier to understand, modify, and refactor.
